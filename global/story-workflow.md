# STORY WORKFLOW

Standard workflow when user starts a new story/task. Follow these steps in order.

---

## TRIGGER PHRASES

Activate this workflow when user says:
- "new story", "start story", "here's the story"
- "new task", "start task", "here's the task"
- "new bug", "start bug", "here's the bug"
- Or posts Azure DevOps screenshots of a story/task/bug at the start of a conversation

---

## STEP 1: EXTRACT & PRESERVE ORIGINAL TEXT

**When user posts story/task screenshots, IMMEDIATELY extract and save the exact text.**

This is the most critical step — the original text gets lost when conversation context is compacted.

### What to extract

**From Story (parent):**
- Description (exact text, preserve Dutch/English, formatting, lists)
- Acceptance Criteria (exact text)
- Discussion (exact text, or "None" if empty)

**From Task or Bug (child):**
- Description (exact text, or "See story" if empty/redundant)
- Discussion (exact text, or "None" if empty)

### Where to save

Create a markdown file in the **`.stories/`** folder in the project root.

**Filename convention:**
- Format: `storyId-taskId-description.md`
- Just the IDs and description, no type/scope prefix
- Strip `#` and `:`, spaces become `-`, all lowercase

Examples:
- PR title: `feat(map): #12345 #67890 add map zoom controls`
- Filename: `.stories/12345-67890-add-map-zoom-controls.md`

**One file per task/bug** — if a story has multiple children, each gets its own file with the shared story context repeated at the top.

### File structure

```markdown
# [PR Title]

**Story:** #[id] / **Task:** #[id]
**Branch:** `type/[story-id]/[task-id]/description`
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**IMPORTANT:** Save this file immediately after extracting text. Do not wait until later steps.

---

## STEP 2: ANALYZE & DISCUSS

After saving the text, explore the relevant codebase and explain back to the user what needs to be done.

**Steps 1 and 2 can run in parallel** — while saving the story text (Step 1), also start exploring the codebase to understand what exists and what needs to be built. This gives you enough context to ask informed questions.

**Rules:**
- Conversational only — NO code examples, NO implementation details yet
- Explain in plain language what the story/task is asking for
- Identify what already exists in the codebase that can be reused
- Confirm understanding with the user before moving to planning
- Goal: both Claude and user agree on WHAT needs to be done before discussing HOW

### Ask clarifying questions with AskUserQuestion

While analyzing, actively identify gaps and ambiguities. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to resolve them — do NOT assume answers or skip over unclear parts.

**When to ask:**
- Something in the story text is vague or could be interpreted multiple ways
- There are multiple valid approaches to a requirement (UX, technical, or architectural)
- A dependency is unclear (is a backend merged? does data exist? what's the source?)
- You found existing code that partially matches but isn't certain to be the right fit
- Business logic has edge cases the story doesn't explicitly cover

**How to ask:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` with concrete options based on what you found in the code
- Frame options around what you discovered — don't ask generic questions
- Group related questions together (up to 4 per call) to avoid back-and-forth
- If you're fairly confident but want confirmation, put your best guess as the first option

**Example patterns:**
- "The story says X, but the codebase has Y. Which should we follow?"
- "This could work as [option A] or [option B] — which fits better?"
- "Is [dependency] available, or do we need to mock it?"
- "The acceptance criteria mention Z but don't specify [detail]. How should this work?"

**After discussion, update the Analysis section** in the story file with a summary of what was agreed, including answers to all clarifying questions.

---

## STEP 3: CREATE PHASED PLAN

Break the work into phases that can be independently verified and committed.

**Rules:**
- Each phase should be small enough that the user can check the code works
- Each phase should produce a visible, testable result where possible
- Suggest WIP commits between phases (per git-instructions.md)
- Phases will later be squashed into a single commit on main via PR

**Update the Implementation Plan section** in the story file with the phases.

**Phase structure:**
```markdown
### Phase 1: [Name]
[What this phase covers — deliverables, not implementation details]

### Phase 2: [Name]
[What this phase covers]

### Phase 3: [Name]
[What this phase covers]
```

---

## STEP 4: DEV TOOLS (IF NEEDED)

Sometimes development requires mock data or special tooling because:
- Backend is not merged yet
- Need to test with different account types/roles
- Need to simulate specific data states

**When needed:**
- Create a small dev tools component for the development period
- Keep it simple — just enough to unblock development
- User decides when to clean it up (no automatic cleanup phase)

---

## STEP 5: EXECUTE PHASES

Work through phases one at a time.

**During implementation:**
- Follow `angular-instructions.md` for all Angular code
- Follow `code-simplicity.md` for keeping code simple
- Focus on making the result work — do NOT run validation during development
- Suggest WIP commits at natural breakpoints between phases
- Wait for user confirmation before moving to the next phase

**Do NOT:**
- Implement everything in one go
- Run validation checks during development (only when explicitly asked)
- Move to the next phase without user confirming the current one works

---

## STEP 6: VALIDATE (WHEN ASKED)

Only run the full validation workflow when the user explicitly asks to validate.

This follows the existing validation rules in `claude.md` — build, lint, prettier, code review.

During development phases, focus entirely on making the feature work correctly.
