# Claude Rules - GRG Wegkenmerken Verkeersborden

This project uses the shared clinerules repository for consistent guidelines across multiple projects.

## Project-Specific Rules
**IMPORTANT**: See [projects/grg-wegkenmerken.md](projects/grg-wegkenmerken.md) for all project-specific guidelines, including:
- Working directory and git operations (must use `traffic-sign-frontend/` subdirectory)
- Branch naming and commit message conventions
- Project structure and technology stack
- Angular/TypeScript patterns
- Design system usage

## Shared Rules
For general guidelines used across all projects, see:
- [angular.md](angular.md) - Angular best practices
- [git-commits.md](git-commits.md) - Git commit standards
- Additional shared rules will be added as needed
